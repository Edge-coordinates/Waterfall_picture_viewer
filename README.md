# WViewer: Waterfall-Style Image Viewer

![doc_home.png](./docs/doc_home.png)

A **waterfall-style** image viewer that traverses a folder and all its subfolders to read and display all images. Images within each folder are shown **sorted by name**.  
If there are too many images, the software splits them into pages based on a configurable number of images per page (default: 40). It supports page navigation and flipping.

## Suitable Use Cases
<details>

When browsing an artist's image pack, you might encounter situations like this:  
![Example](./docs/1.png)

- Many subfolders, each containing only a few images, making it hard to browse them enjoyably.
- Even with **extra-large icons** in file explorer, browsing can feel cumbersome.
- To enlarge and view a specific image, you must open a separate image viewer, which can be inconvenient.
- Third-party viewers often require library setup, continuous additions, etc., but sometimes you just want to browse a folder's images quickly!

**That's why this software was created—to solve all your needs!!!**

For details, see [Usage Examples](#usage-examples).

## Features
- 💡 **Show Everything**: Recursively traverse the selected folder **and all its subfolders**, displaying images sorted by name.
- 🔑 **Convenience**: Simply drag a folder into the program to view its images—**zero configuration, zero side effects**!!!
- ⚡ **Speed**: Configurable images per page to avoid lag during image loading.
- 🦋 **Waterfall Layout**: Aesthetic and elegant.
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts**: ~~Page navigation shortcuts~~ and image navigation shortcuts (Left/Right keys supported).
- 🛠️ **Practical Image Viewer**: ([photoswipe](https://github.com/dimsemenov/photoswipe)) Supports standard image viewer operations like zooming, rotating, and browsing previous/next images.
- 🖥️ **Customizable Settings**: Configurable number of images per page (if your hard drive is slow or individual images are large, a smaller number like 10–20 is recommended). Includes a filter for selecting specific image types.

## Warnings
- Loading a large number of images may cause lag due to slow hard drive read speeds—please be patient.
- If the images are large and your hard drive performs poorly, browsing may be sluggish. In such cases, consider using an SSD or reducing the number of images displayed per page.

## Apologies
Due to time constraints (~~final year of high school~~) and limited personal skills (~~just a noob~~), the software may have several issues and suboptimal performance. Please be understanding and feel free to contribute code improvements!

## Finally
If you like this project, please consider giving it a **Star**—it would satisfy my tiny bit of vanity!!! 😊
